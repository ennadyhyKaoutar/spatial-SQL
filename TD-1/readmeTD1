# Installation of PostGIS and Creation of a Spatial Database

## 1. Download and Install PostgreSQL
1. Go to the [PostgreSQL download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to download the latest version compatible with your operating system (Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD, Solaris).
2. Follow the installation guide to install PostgreSQL on your machine.
3. During installation, set a password for the `postgres` user. **Note this password**, as you will need it to connect to PostgreSQL.

## 2. Download and Install PostGIS
1. During the installation of PostgreSQL, check **all necessary components**, including **Stack Builder**.
2. After installation, **launch Stack Builder**. This will allow you to download PostGIS, a spatial database extension.
3. In Stack Builder:
   - Select the PostgreSQL version corresponding to your installation.
   - Choose the **PostGIS** extension (it will usually be checked automatically).
   - You can check "Create a spatial database" if you wish, but this tutorial will guide you to create it via pgAdmin 4.
4. Follow the wizard steps and specify the installation folder.
5. Once installation is complete, click **Close** to finalize the installation.

## 3. Create a Database with pgAdmin 4
1. Launch **pgAdmin 4**, a PostgreSQL database management tool.
2. Log in with the password you set during installation.
3. Expand the **Servers** section, right-click on PostgreSQL > **Create** > **Database**.
4. Name your database (e.g., `spatial-db-1`), then click **Save**.

## 4. Add the PostGIS Extension to the Database
1. In pgAdmin 4, expand the **Databases** section and select your database (`spatial-db-1`).
2. Right-click on your database and click **Query Tool**.
3. In the query editor, type the following command:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
